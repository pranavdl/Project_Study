Use Case of the Project :
1. To make prediction of home loan should be approved or not to the borrower.
2. To analyse the borrower's background with his income, dependents on borrower, credit history.
2. To check the repaying capacity of the customer and other pending loans and on that basis we will do prediction using machine learning models.
3. To automate this process for easy and quick response for classification of borrower in approved and not approved loan.
